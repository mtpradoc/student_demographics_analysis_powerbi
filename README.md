# Student Demographics Analysis Using Power BI

## Overview

This project explores the demographics of students that applied to the **Tech Moms** program using application data. The dataset provides insights into the employment status, education levels, household income, and diversity of the applicants. Using Power BI, I visualized key trends such as employment categories, income distribution, and the representation of various racial and ethnic groups. The goal is to understand the applicant/student profile and support program decision-making for future cohorts.

## Project Details

### 1. Dataset

The dataset consists of various fields including:
- **Applicant Status**: Tracks the application status (e.g., "Assigned Cohort", "Declined Attending").
- **Employment Status**: Includes categories such as "Full-Time", "Part-Time", and "Unemployed."
- **Education Level**: Ranges from "Some College" to "Bachelor's or Above."
- **Household Income**: Shows the income brackets for each applicant's household.
- **Race/Ethnicity**: Identifies the racial or ethnic group of the applicants.
- **Create Date**: The date when the application was submitted.

### 2. Data Preparation in Power BI

- **Imported the dataset** into Power BI.
- Created measures and calculated columns for categories such as **employment status**, **income brackets**, and **education levels**.
- Segmented the applicants by **education level** and **race/ethnicity** for a more detailed analysis.
- Used **DAX functions** to calculate percentages for employment status and income distribution.

- **Displayed the racial and ethnic composition** of the applicants.
- **Purpose**: Analyze the diversity of the applicant pool with a focus on BIPOC+ groups.
- **Visualization Type**: Pie chart labeled "Diversity Representation"

#### Number of Students per Cohort
- **Visualized the growth in cohort sizes** from 2020 to 2024.
- **Purpose**: Analyze trends in student enrollment and identify factors contributing to changes in cohort sizes.
- **Visualization Type**: Line or bar chart labeled "Number of Students per Cohort"

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
This section highlights important demographic metrics of the applicants:
- **Unemployed (30.40%)**
- **Household Income <50K (43.88%)**
- **Single Mothers (42.09%)**
- **High School / Some College (51.98%)**
- **BIPOC+ (37.23%)**

### 4. Final Dashboard
- Combined all visualizations into a comprehensive dashboard in Power BI.
- **Purpose**: Provide an overview of employment, income, education, and diversity trends for applicants to the Tech Moms program.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**: Used for data preparation, analysis, and visualization.
- **CSV**: Cleaned dataset containing application details for the Tech Moms program.
